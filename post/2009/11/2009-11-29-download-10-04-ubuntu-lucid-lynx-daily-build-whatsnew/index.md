Ubuntu 10.04 daily build is now available for download at the Ubuntu Website. Here you go: [http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/daily-live/current/](http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/daily-live/current/) UPDATE: Beta 1 is available [here](http://www.ubuntu.com/testing/lucid/beta1)

However, if you are using Karmic already, don't expect anything changed soon. It is almost like Karmic at the time of this posting. Changes will start to appear later. UPDATE Feb, 2010: Alpha 3 brings theme changes. UPDATE: Beta 1 brings other signification changes.

Having said that, they have plans to bring about following changes with Lucid Lynx: [**Gwibber**](https://launchpad.net/gwibber) Gwibber is an open source microblogging client for GNOME developed with Python and GTK. It supports Twitter, Jaiku, Identi.ca, Facebook, Flickr, Digg, and RSS.

[**PiTiVi**](https://launchpad.net/pitivi) PiTiVi allows users to easily edit audio/video projects based on the GStreamer framework: Capture audio and video; mix, resize, cut, apply effects to audio/video sources; Render/Save the projects to any format supported by the GStreamer framework. UPDATE: I don't think PiTiVi will make it though.

**GIMP** The default installation will not contain GIMP image editor. It can of course be installed via repository though. UPDATE: As of beta 1, GIMP has been removed.

**Compiz-Settings** Simple Compiz Settings GUI may be included with Lucid. Compiz config settings manager or Simple ccsm are currently installable in older versions of Ubuntu with compiz via package manager. This may be included with the default install in Lucid Lynx. UPDATE: I don't know if they are still considering the idea though.

**10 Second Boot** Although, boot speed has increased with every version of Ubuntu, the target of Lucid is to reduce the boot time to 10 seconds with Dell Mini with SSD. UPDATE: And by what I can see with Beta 1 on my Desktop (without SSD), I'm sure Dell Mini SSD users are already very close to that.

**Theme Overhaul** Ubuntu has gone a theme and brand overhaul changing the default looks for Ubuntu, its logos and much more. You will see a completely different look and feel for Ubuntu 10.04. Please read the latest posts of my blog to find out more.

Lucid will be an LTS release and there may not be many changes. Developers will work on delivering a stable and bug-free Ubuntu with increased hardware support.

I am desperately waiting for the 1st Alpha release as most changes will probably be visible with the early Alpha releases. UPDATE: I have upgraded to Beta 1 now and am waiting for the final release.

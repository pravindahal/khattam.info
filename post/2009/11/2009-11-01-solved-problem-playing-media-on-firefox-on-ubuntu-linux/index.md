I am using Ubuntu 9.10 Karmic Koala on my Desktop with Firefox 3.5 as my primary browser. Recently I was facing problems playing online media (streaming mp3s, non-flash) including FM from my own page on Firefox.The fix was to remove all of the plugins mozilla-plugin-vlc and install only either mozilla-mplayer or totem-mozilla (or both).

Hope this helps.

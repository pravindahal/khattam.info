I am using Ubuntu 10.04 Lucid Lynx Alpha 2 and when I updated today, when I held down a key, I did not get repeated keypresses as I would normally. I don't know which update actually caused this, but it was due to some packages I upgraded recently (any ideas?).  
I just went to Keyboard Preferences (System > Preferences > Keyboard) and checked "Key presses repeat when key is held down" but it still did not work, for some reason. Then, I just played around with the sliders (Delay and Speed) and it started working.  
Finally, I typed in the Test Field and set the preferences to my taste.  
I have written this just in case somebody does not figure this out themselves.  
Hope this is helpful.

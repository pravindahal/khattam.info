Ubuntu 10.10 Marvick Meerkat [has been announced](http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/336) at [Shuttleworth's Blog](http://www.markshuttleworth.com/) today, April 2, 2010 which should be released in October 2010.

It will probably have loads of new features that have been held back in Lucid Lynx since it is LTS (Long Term Support) version. I will probably be trying it out from the 1st Alpha release and keep you updated about the feature additions (what's new) and changes. I think Maverick will feature gnome-shell, rgba support and more.

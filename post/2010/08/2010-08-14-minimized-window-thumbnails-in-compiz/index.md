Here is a video showing live animated thumbnails for minimized windows in compiz: \[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgvUJ3MSej8?fs=1&hl=en\_US&w=480&h=385\]

This was posted in [compiz developer SmSpillaz's blog](http://smspillaz.wordpress.com/2010/08/07/some-weekend-hacking/). Hope this will be added to stable compiz soon.

Firebug is not officially compatible with Firefox 6 since as of this writing, Firefox 6 is on early alphas. However, forcing compatibility works with it. For that, just install [Nightly Tester Tools addon](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/nightly-tester-tools/) and in Tools>Nightly Tester Tools, check "Force Addon Compatibility" and restart Firefox. Now, you will be able to install and use Firebug.

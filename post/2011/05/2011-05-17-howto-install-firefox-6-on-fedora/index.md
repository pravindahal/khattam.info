Firefox 6 alpha 1 nightly has been available for quite a while now. You can download and install it on Fedora and other RPM based distros from the [Firefox Nightly page](http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/latest-trunk/). Search for the latest rpm and download it and then install it by double clicking on the RPM. To launch it, go to Internet menu and launch "Nightly".

I am using Fedora 15 and in the menu, I just saw the menu item for Suspend and no Shutdown. It is shown when I press Alt, but I wanted to show it at all times. There is a simple fix for this and it involves installing a package. Open up **Add/Remove Software** (**Applications**\>**System**\>**Add/Remove Software**) and then search for "gnome-shell-extensions-alternative-status-menu" and install it. Log out and log back in and you should see the menu item.

I had played a great indie game a few years back. It was called Street Bike Fury from S64 Games. The game is no longer being developed because of death of the developer. I had tried to make this game run earlier but failed. However, I have found a way now and I would like to share that.

After some research, I found that the game was developed using Game Maker 6. The programs made in this only run in Windows XP and not in Windows 7 and Windows Vista. However, in YoYoGames Wiki, there is a software that can fix this. First download and setup [Street Bike Fury](http://shawn64.com/sbf.php) from [official download page](http://shawn64.com/sbf.php). Then, download the Game Maker Conversion Program from [here](http://wiki.yoyogames.com/images/7/77/GM_Convert_Game.zip). Then setup the game but don't launch it. Use the GM\_Convert\_Game and patch the exe. Then you will be able to run it.

Hope this helps.
